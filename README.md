The Odin Project Recipe Project
This is a project of The Odin Project which I will practice the first principles and knowledges that I had of HTML and later I am going to iterate with CSS.
    In HTML I am going to practice those concepts below:
        - HTML Boilerplate
            - Head <head></head>
            - Body <body></body>
            - Lan <lan="en">
            - Meta <meta charset="UTF-8">
        - Headings and paragraphes
        - Ordered Lists <ol> and Unordered Lists <ul>
            - Lists <li> itslef
        - Absolute and Relative Links
            <a></a>
            <href>
            <target>
            <rel>
        - Absolute and Relative Images
            <img>
            <src:>
            <alt:"">
    
    In CSS as I did not have classes yet, I will discover what I am going to do later
