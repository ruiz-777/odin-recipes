            <h1>Cashew Cream Cheese</h1>

                <img src="../images/cashew_cream_cheese.webp" alt="A Delicious Cashew Cream Cheese" height="400" width="250">

            <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>The cashew cream cheese is rich, creamy, and completely dairy-free, blending soaked cashews with lemon and seasonings for a naturally tangy flavor. Smooth and versatile, it spreads beautifully on bread or crackers and doubles as a wholesome base for dips and plant-based creations.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cup (300 g) raw cashews, soaked for 6 to 8 hours (or 30 min in hot water for a quick version)</li>
                    <li>5 tbsp lemon juice</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp water (adjust for creaminess)</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp nutritional yeast (optional, adds a cheesy flavor)</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp of soy sauce (or tamari, for gluten-free)</li>
                    <li>½ tsp salt (reduce if soy sauce is salty enough)</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp olive oil (optional, for extra smoothness)</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Drain the cashews and place them in a blender or food processor.</li>
                    <li>Add lemon juice, nutritional yeast, apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, salt, and (if using) olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Add water gradually, blending and stopping to check the texture until it reaches your desired creaminess.
                        <ul>
                            <li>For a thicker spread → use less water.</li> 
                            <li>For a softer, creamier cheese → add more water.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Blend until smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides as needed.</li>
                    <li>Chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour before serving.</li>
                </ol>
            
            <h2>Personal Notes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I did not use olive oil either time I made this recipe. I think there are enough fat in the cashews already. I like the texture that way, I'm going try add olive oil next time though.</li>
                    <li>The apple vinegar and soy sauce make all difference for achieving the real cream cheese flavor.</li>
                    <li>I am doubling the recipe because of my blender size - it is too big, and 150g of cashew was too little to blend properly. The first time, I had to add more water so it would blend, and it end up softer than I wanted though.</li>
                </ul>
