            <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>The cashew cream cheese is rich, creamy, and completely dairy-free, blending soaked cashews with lemon and seasonings for a naturally tangy flavor. Smooth and versatile, it spreads beautifully on bread or crackers and doubles as a wholesome base for dips and plant-based creations.</p>
