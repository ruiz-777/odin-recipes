            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Our Damn Good Cookies are a chewy, plant-based treat made with dates, oats, nuts, and dark chocolate chips for natural sweetness and crunch. Packed with fiber, healthy fats, and rich flavor, they’re a wholesome snack that feels indulgent but stays true to clean, nourishing ingredients.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>½ cup raw almonds (or raw cashews)</li>
                <li>½ cup raw walnuts</li>
                <li>6 large pitted dates</li>
                <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 tbsp water (only if needed for texture)</li>
                <li>Pinch of sea salt (optional)</li>
                <li>3 tbsp vegan dark chocolate chips</li>
                <li>3 tbsp old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
                <li>Scoop small portions with a spoon, shape into balls or slightly flatten into cookies</li>
                <li>Serve immediately or refrigerate for a firmer texture.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            
            <ol>

                <li>In a food processor or blender, pulse the almonds and walnuts until finely ground. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In the processor, blend the dates, vanilla extract, and water until a thick paste forms. Scrape down the sides as needed.</li>
                <li>Combine the nut flour with the date paste until fully incorporated.</li>
                <li>Stir in the oats and dark chocolate chips. Mix gently.</li>

            </ol>

            <h2>Personal Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I used cashew instead of almonds. It was perfect!</li>
