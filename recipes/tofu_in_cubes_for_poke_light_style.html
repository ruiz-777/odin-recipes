            <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>The tofu cubes are lightly marinated with soy sauce, ginger, and sesame for a fresh, clean flavor that shines in every bite. With a tender texture and delicate taste, they're perfect for a light poke bowl, adding plant-based protein without weighing you down.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Firm tofu → ~120 to 150 g per serving (½ of a 400 g block)</li>
                    <li>Soy sauce → 2 tbsp</li>
                    <li>Toasted sesame oil → 1 tsp (just for aroma)</li>
                    <li>Juice of ½ lime or lemon</li>
                    <li>Fresh ginger, grated → 1 tsp</li>
                    <li>(Optional) pinch of garlic powder or chili flakes</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Press the tofu → wrap it in a clean towel and place a weight on top for 15 to 20 min to remove excess water.</li>
                    <li>Cut into cubes.</li>
                    <li>Marinate → place the cubes in a bowl with soy sauce, sesame oil, lime juice, and ginger. Let it sit for 20 to 30 min (the longer, the more flavor).</li>
                    <li>Cook:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Airfryer: 180 °C (355 °F) for 10 to 15 min, shaking halfway.</li>
                            <li>Non-stick pan: with or without a tiny drizzle of oil, sear until golden on all sides.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The result: crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, lightly citrusy and aromatic.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Personal Notes</h2>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>I cut the tofu in half horizontally and then into cubes. It was harder to sear in the pan, but it was perfect for poke and as a snack though.</li>
                    <li>I marinated it in a ziplock bag for about just 30 minutes — it was perfect to mix the sauce and season the tofu cubes.</li>
                    <li>The flavor was perfect and super light on the stomach.</li>
                </ul>
